I've been contemplating what I  might write about in a blog post this week and I decided why not write about something I have been feeling a bit weird about lately.

**OMG -- I think I am becoming mature yet 'adolescent' like at the same time ! **

* I am learning a ton about myself every day and finding love, joy and fun in a whole bunch of places.
* I have become pretty low-key at times.
* I have expanded upon my ability to make people laugh pretty darn hard at times.
* In the past year, I learned respect from a 15-year-old.
* I learned what it means to have a very busy life from a 99-year-old.
* I formed a new cherished friendship with a 20 something year old relative.
* I have experienced the joy, love, and fun from forming and sharing live in an adolescent type way with a special friend.
* I now strongly believe in synchrodestiny and embrace Deepak Chopra's definition of it which is_"SynchroDestiny is when you consciously manifest your destiny through intention using the phenomenon of synchronicity or meaningful correspondence or meaningful coincidence."_
* 99% of the time now -- I always see the glass at least 90% full.  However, I have cringed a few times when someone has mistaken me for someone's mother.
* I am beginning to feel like I understand my purpose in life at least for the next decade or so.
* In the past year, I have directly connected with my Spirit a few meaningful times.

**Okay BOOMER FOR LIFE FOLLOWERS -- I JUST POURED MY HEART OUT. Do you have anything to say? ****Don't leave me dangling here.. at the very least tell me how you think I am becoming a weirdo**if you are not willing to share something personal that makes you feel like you are maturing and/or becoming more adolescent like as well.
