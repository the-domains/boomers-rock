A few weeks ago, I met a young man who taught me a few things about nature. His name is Benji and he is part of a company called Third Eye Pinecones. Their website address is [http://conesandstones.com][0].

Third Eye Pinecone necklaces are made from a cross-section  of a living pinecone. I of course now own one. Go check them out and while you are there be sure to search for the back story about the founder of this company and why he created it. The story is mind-blowing. You'll understand how this too young to be a Boomer founder and all of his workers are living the life of hippies.

Call me math illiterate but I had never heard about the Golden Spiral ratio and I never knew how nature was such a living example of this phenomenon.  Benji educated me on what such things as pinecones, the human ear, sunflowers, galaxies and hurricanes all have in common.  "They all have inherent spiral shapes that conform almost perfectly to the 'golden spiral', which is derived from a mathematical formula. A golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral with a growth factor of 'Phi', which is the golden ratio -- that means it gets wider by a factor of Phi for every quarter turn it makes." (Wikipedia).

This new math knowledge of mine led me to do a search for --**Nature by Numbers**on YouTube. I urge you to go do the same. There are a huge number of incredible videos on this subject.  Also I urge you to go and do an online search for the Golden Spiral in Nature to see how cool the universe is.  Enjoy!
