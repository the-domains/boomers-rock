One thing we boomers did really well in our 20's was DEMONSTRATING!  How about if  you get really psyched about doing something for an important cause right here, right now in 2016\.

Last night I watched a documentary that was recently released called -- "This Changes Everything." It is really eye-opening and so Boomeresque. It shows what has been going on all over the world these past few years connecting the carbon in the air with the economic systems that put it there. It is based on a New York Times best seller book written in 2014 by Naomi Klein.

This Film was shot over 211 days in nine countries and five continents. The film presents seven portraits of communities on the front lines, from Montana's Powder River Basin to the Alberta Tar Sands, from the coast of South India to Beijing . Throughout the film, Klein builds to her most controversial and exciting idea: that we can seize the existential crisis of climate change to transform our failed economic system into something radically better.

What if confronting the climate crisis is the best chance we'll ever get to build a better worlld. The film closes with a fascinating concept ...what if we built  renewable energy resources in the very locations that have been devastated  by such things as the Alberta Tar Sands in Canada  and coal mines in countries like Greece that were forced to make tough economic choices in just the past few years.

Boomers get active! Pick a cause you can sink your teeth into. And, lead the way to a better world in 2016\. Namaste.
