Yes I am indeed a Baby Boomer. I grew up in Taunton, Massachusetts and lived in various spots in Massachusetts before spending a brief stint in Chicago and a few years in Washington D.C.  My ancestry makes me a genuine 100% Portuguese gal. I have an undergraduate degree in Economics and an MBA from BabsonCollege in Wellesley, Ma.

In 1982, I moved to Maine for a job, and to escape the humidity of DC and the crazy political environment. I knew no one but thought that was okay. I also thought, what the hell am I going to do living in Maine when I am not working?  Oh well, I can live anywhere for a year or two until I decide what I really want to do next. That was of course 30 years ago.

My current business cards label me as a Serial Entrepreneur. Strategist.  Explorer. I also recently adopted the additional title of Fun Bundler. My life mantra is "Having Fun is a Priority!"

I have grown to not like the cold and snowy winters in Maine at all.  I have a warm weather get away condo in Florida. I really don't like Florida either but I like to escape to generally 40+ degrees warmer 'winter' weather when the mood strikes me.

If you have a burning desire to know more about my entrepreneurial and/or professional corporate background life -- e-mail me.

Namaste, Pat Pinto (AKA Pinto Bean)
